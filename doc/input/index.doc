\page dev_steps Steps in construction of the example module

The example module chosen to illustrate the process of SALOME module
development is extremely simple. The module contains a single
component and this component provides a single service called \b
makeBanner that accepts a character string as the sole argument and
that returns a character string obtained by the concatenation of a
'Hello' and the input string. The component also provides a simple
GUI.

The steps in the development are as follows:
- create a module tree structure
- create a SALOME component that can be loaded by a Python SALOME container
- configure the module so that the component is known to SALOME
- add a graphic GUI

\ref index "<< Previous"<br>\ref tree_structure ">> Next"

\page tree_structure Create the module tree structure

The first step in the development process is the creation of the
module tree file structure. The typical SALOME module usually includes
some set of the configuration files (used in the build procedure of a
module), Makefiles, IDL file that provides a definition of a CORBA
services implemented in a module and a set of source Python files
which implement the module CORBA engine and (optionally) its GUI.

The following file structure is typical for the SALOME module:

<pre>
+ PYHELLO1_SRC
   + CMakeLists.txt
   + SalomePYHELLOConfig.cmake.in
   + adm_local
     + CMakeLists.txt
     + cmake_files
       + CMakeLists.txt
       + FindSalomePYHELLO.cmake
   + bin
     + CMakeLists.txt
     + VERSION.in
     + runPYHELLO.in
     + runPYHELLO.py
   + idl
     + CMakeLists.txt
     + PYHELLO_Gen.idl
   + src
     + CMakeLists.txt
     + PYHELLO
       + CMakeLists.txt
       + PYHELLO.py
       + PYHELLO_utils.py
     + PYHELLOGUI
       + CMakeLists.txt
       + PYHELLOGUI.py
       + PYHELLO_msg_en.ts
       + PYHELLO_msg_fr.ts
       + PYHELLO_icons.ts
   + resources
     + CMakeLists.txt
     + PYHELLO.png
     + PYHELLO_small.png
     + ExecPYHELLO.png
     + handshake.png
     + stop.png
     + PYHELLOCatalog.xml.in
     + SalomeApp.xml.in
     + schema.xml
   + doc
     + CMakeLists.txt
     + doxyfile.in
     + index.doc
</pre>

Note that other files can be optionally present. For example, in some
SALOME modules sources tree you can find such files as AUTHORS,
INSTALL, ChangeLog, COPYING, NEWS, README, etc. Some files are
specific only for this PYHELLO sample module, for example PNG images
in the resources directory which are used in the GUI dialog boxes etc.

The usual way of the sources directory tree structure initial creation
is to copy it from the existing SALOME module.

\warning The files of the platform base module (KERNEL) must not be
copied to initialise a module tree structure. It is usually preferable
to copy files from another module such as GEOM or MED.

The module name is PYHELLO, the component name is PYHELLO and all the
files are put in a directory named PYHELLO1_SRC.
Below is a short description of these files. Note, that files with .in
suffix are the cmake templates from which the actual files are
generated during the build procedure.

- \c CMakeLists.txt

These files are input text files that contain the project parameters 
and describe the flow control of the build process in simple CMake language as 
a part of the build system based on CMake. These files define 
the build procedure, namely, compilation and installation rules such as compiler 
and linker options, installation destination folder, package version etc.

- \c adm_local

This directory contains additional administrative files used by the
build procedure.

- \c adm_local/cmake_files/FindSalomePYHELLO.cmake
 
Some modules can need some external packages in order to compile and 
run properly. The usual approach is to write a special *.cmake file
for the purpose of finding a certain piece of software and to set it's
libraries, include files and definitions into appropriate variables so that
they can be used in the build process of another project.
It is possible to include the standard CMake detection modules (FindXyz.cmake files,
located in the standard CMake installation directory) or, if CMake does not provide
a search procedure for some required software, it is necessary to create *.cmake
module for each pre-requisite.

Also, it is good idea to create and distribute *.cmake file for the project being
developed; it can be used then in the dependent projects. For example, PYHELLO module
installs a file FindSalomePYHELLO.cmake that can be used for its detection.

To search SALOME PYHELLO module in some other project it will be only needed to write
the following code in CMakeLists.txt: 

\code
FIND_PACKAGE(SalomePYHELLO)
\endcode

- \c bin

This directory usually contains different scripts.

- bin/VERSION.in

This file is used to document the module, it must give its version (at
least) and (optionally) compatibilities or incompatibilities with
other modules. This file is strongly recommended but is not essential
for operation of the module.

- bin/runPYHELLO.in
- bin/runPYHELLO.py

These files are not essential but make the example easier to
use. These are scripts that can be used to run SALOME session with
PYHELLO module.

- \c idl

This directory contains IDL files that specify the CORBA services
supplied by SALOME module.

- idl/PYHELLO_Gen.idl

This is the CORBA IDL definition of the services implemented by SALOME
PYHELLO module.

- \c src

This is a root directory of the module source codes. Usually it contains
one or more sub-directories that provide an implementation of module
libraries, executables, Python API modules, etc. The hierarchy of the
sources tree is arbitrary; it follows the specific module needs.

- src/PYHELLO/PYHELLO.py
- src/PYHELLO/PYHELLO_utils.py

These files provide the implementation of a CORBA engine of the
PYHELLO module. In particular, this is an implementation of the 
services defined in the PYHELLO_Gen.idl file.

- src/PYHELLOGUI/PYHELLOGUI.py

The src/PYHELLOGUI is an optional directory that provides an
implementation of PYHELLO module's GUI. Strictly speaking, the
GUI is optional for each SALOME module. In some cases it's
enough to implement CORBA engine only. Then, the services of the
module will be avaiable in a CORBA environment. The module can be
loaded to the SALOME container and its services can be used in the
Supervisor computation schemas, in Python scripts or/and refer to it
in other modules. A GUI is necessary in the cases if it is planned to
access to the module functionality from the SALOME GUI session via
menu actions, dialog boxes and so on.

- src/PYHELLOGUI/PYHELLO_msg_en.ts
- src/PYHELLOGUI/PYHELLO_msg_fr.ts
- src/PYHELLOGUI/PYHELLO_icons.ts

These files provide a description (internationalization) of GUI
resources of the PYHELLO module. \c PYHELLO_msg_en.ts provides an English
translation of the string resources used in a module. \c PYHELLO_icons.ts
defines images and icons resources used within the GUI of the
PYHELLO module. Please refer to Qt linguist documentation for more
details.

- \c resources

This optional directory usually contains different resources files
required for the correct operation of SALOME module.

- resources/PYHELLO.png
- resources/PYHELLO_small.png
- resources/ExecPYHELLO.png
- resources/handshake.png
- resources/stop.png

The resources folder usually includes different resource files used
within the SALOME module. For example, PYHELLO.png file provides an icon
of PYHELLO module to be shown in the SALOME GUI desktop. ExecPYHELLO.png is
an icon for the makeBanner() function used in the menu and
toolbar. The icons handshake.png and stop.png are used in the dialog
boxes and PYHELLO_small.png icon is used to display in the Object
browser for root PYHELLO entity.

- resources/PYHELLOCatalog.xml.in

The XML description of the CORBA services provided by the PYHELLO
module. This file is parsed by Supervisor and YACS module to generate
the list of service nodes to be used in the calculation schemas. The
simplest way to create this file is to use Catalog Generator utility
provided by the SALOME KERNEL module, that can automatically generate
XML description file from the IDL file.

- resources/SalomeApp.xml.in

This file is essential for the module. It provides some parameters of
the module which define module behavior in SALOME. In particular it
should provide a section with the name corresponding to the name of a
module ("PYHELLO" in this case) with the following parameters:
\code
  <section name="PYHELLO">
    <parameter name="name"            value="PyHello"/>
    <parameter name="icon"            value="PYHELLO.png"/>
    <parameter name="library"         value="SalomePyQtGUI"/>
    <parameter name="documentation"   value="pyhello_help"/>
    <parameter name="version"         value="@SALOMEPYHELLO_VERSION@"/>
  </section>
\endcode

The \a "name" parameter defines GUI name of a module. The \a "icon"
parameter defines a GUI icon of a module. The parameter \a "library"
specifies the name of the C++ library representing the front-end of
the module in the SALOME GUI desktop. The Python modules which do not
implement its own C++ front-end GUI library should specify
"SalomePyQtGUI" value in this parameter. The \a "documentation" parameter
provides a name for the help-related resource section (see below).
The \a "version" parameter defines the version of the module.

The section \a "resources" also specifies the directory that contains
resources of a module (icons, translation files, etc).

\code
  <section name="resources">
    <parameter name="PYHELLO" value="${PYHELLO_ROOT_DIR}/share/salome/resources/pyhello"/>
  </section>
\endcode

The section \a "pyhello_help" provides information on the location of 
the help page and the eventual sub-menu in the Help menu.

\code
  <section name="pyhello_help" >
    <parameter name="sub_menu"        value="Samples"/>
    <parameter name="%1 User's Guide" value="%PYHELLO_ROOT_DIR%/share/doc/salome/gui/PYHELLO/index.html"/>
  </section>
\endcode

- doc/doxyfile.in

The Doxygen configuration file. The Doxygen is used to build this
documentation. The file doxyfile.in provides a rules for the
generation of module documentation.

- doc/index.doc

An input file for the Doxygen, which provides a source of this documentation.

- \c doc/images

This sub-folder contains images used in the documentation.

- \c doc/static

This sub-folder contains auxiliary files used when generating documentation
by Doxygen, like header (\c header.html.in) and footer (\c footer.html)
of the HTML pages, style sheet (\c doxygen.css) etc.

\ref dev_steps "<< Previous"<br>\ref build_proc_files ">> Next"

\page build_proc_files Build procedure input files

In most cases SALOME uses \b CMake-based build system for modules.
CMake is a cross-platform build system which works on Linux, Windows
and other operating systems.

The \c CMakeLists.txt files are used to describe the build procedure,
in particular:
- Test platform;
- Test system configuration;
- Detect pre-requisites;
- Generate build rules (for example, standard UNIX makefiles on Linux,
  MSVC solutions, etc).

Project's root directory provides main CMake configuration that allows 
build all targets into one set of binaries and libraries. Each sub-directory
also includes CMake configuration file (CMakeLists.txt) that specifies
targets being build.

The file \c CMakeLists.txt in root directory of the PYHELLO module provides 
basic build rules to be used in other \c CMakeLists.txt files. 
It sets main properties of project: name, version, pre-requisites, 
installation paths, programming languages being used by the project,
tree of sub-directories, etc.

A lot of files used by the build procedure of HELLO module are located
in SALOME KERNEL module (that is referenced by the \c KERNEL_ROOT_DIR
environment variable), namely in its \c salome_adm sub-folder.
Similarly, the \c GUI_ROOT_DIR environment variable is used for the
graphical user interface (GUI) module of SALOME; this module also
provides a set of configuration utilities (\c *.cmake files) in its 
\c adm_local folder.

The files with an \c .in extension are the skeletons which are processed
by CMake to transform it to the resulting files in the build directory during
the configuration process.

\ref tree_structure "<< Previous"<br>\ref idl_dir ">> Next"

\page idl_dir The idl directory

The \c idl directory requires a \c CMakeLists.txt that must make the
compilation of the CORBA IDL \c PYHELLO_Gen.idl file and install all the
generated files into the correct module installation directories.
This is done by using \c OMNIORB_ADD_MODULE() CMake macro:

\code
OMNIORB_ADD_MODULE(SalomeIDLPYHELLO PYHELLO_Gen.idl ${KERNEL_ROOT_DIR}/idl/salome ${KERNEL_SalomeIDLKernel})
INSTALL(TARGETS SalomeIDLPYHELLO EXPORT ${PROJECT_NAME}TargetGroup DESTINATION ${SALOME_INSTALL_LIBS})
\endcode

The idl file itself must define a CORBA module for which the name must
be different from the module name to avoid name conflicts and define a
CORBA interface that is derived at least from the EngineComponent interface  
of the Engines module. The name of the CORBA module will be
\b PYHELLO_ORB and the name of the interface will be \b PYHELLO_Gen. 

\ref build_proc_files "<< Previous"<br>\ref src_dir ">> Next"

\page src_dir The src directory

The src contains all source files required to build and install CORBA
engine and (optionally) GUI of the module. Each of these entities usually
has (but this is not actually obligatory) its own directory.

The \c CMakeLists.txt file triggers the path of sub-directories described
by the \a ADD_SUBDIRECTORY() command.

- The src/PYHELLO directory

This directory contains the Python files that implement the engine
of the module. The \c CMakeLists.txt defines the rules used to install these
files to the destination folder. The name of the module
engine Python file is predefined and should be set as <MODULE>.py
where <MODULE> is a name of the module. In the case of the PYHELLO
module, the name of the engine Python script should be PYHELLO.so.

The \c PYHELLO.py Python script implements PYHELLO class that is derived
from the PYHELLO_Gen interface of the PYHELLO_ORB__POA CORBA module,
the SALOME_ComponentPy_i class (base implementation of SALOME
Python module engine exported by the KERNEL module) and
SALOME_DriverPy_i class that provides base implementation of
persistence mechanism.

In particular, \a PYHELLO class implements makeBanner() function that is
defined in the IDL interface PYHELLO_ORB::PYHELLO_Gen. 

\code
def makeBanner( self, name ):
    banner = "Hello %s!" % name
    return banner
\endcode

Other services
defined in PYHELLO_Gen CORBA interface also should be implemented by
this class.

- The src/PYHELLOGUI directory

This directory contains the Python files that implement the GUI
of PYHELLO module. The name of the module GUI Python script is
predefined and should be set as <MODULE>GUI.py where <MODULE> is a
name of the module. In the case of the PYHELLO module, the name of the
GUI Python script should be PYHELLOGUI.py.

The implementation of GUI of the PYHELLO module should be done
according to the architecture and rules specified by the SALOME GUI
module. The PYHELLO.py script should implement a set of the functions
which define the module behavior in GUI, for example, create menus,
toolbars, define context popup menus, objects selection behavior,
implement dialog boxes etc.
 
Here below is a short description of these methods. For more details
please refer to the SALOME GUI module documentation.

- initialize() - module first initialization; usually used to create
  GUI actions, menus, toolbars and so on;
- activate() - module activation; perform actions which should
  be done when the module is activated by the user;
- deactivate() - module deactivation; perform actions which should
  be done when the module is deactivated by the user;
- windows() - get a list and a position of the windows to be
  associated with the module; these windows will be automatically
  opened and positioned according to the setting defined by the value
  returned by this function;
- views() - get a list of the compatible viewers; these viewers
  will be automatically opened/raised on the module activation;
- createPopupMenu() - create and return context popup menu according
  to the current selection;
- createPreferences() - initialize module's preferences;
- preferenceChanged() - callback function that is called when some
  module's preference is changed by the user; allows to perform the
  corresponding actions;
- engineIOR() - to get the reference to the module CORBA engine

Note, that some of these methods are optional and need not be
obligatory implemented because SalomePyQtGUI_Module class provides a
base implementation of these functions. It's sometimes enough to
implement only some of them, depending on the module needs.

In the case of PYHELLO module, some of these functions are
implemented to provide a sample for the development:

- engineIOR() that initializes PYHELLO module's eggine:

\code
def engineIOR():
    IOR = ""
    if getORB() and getEngine():
        IOR = getORB().object_to_string( getEngine() )
        pass
    return IOR
\endcode

- initialize() that sets default module preferences

\code
def initialize():
    if not sgPyQt.hasSetting( "PYHELLO", "def_obj_name"):
        sgPyQt.addSetting( "PYHELLO", "def_obj_name", GUIcontext.DEFAULT_NAME )
    if not sgPyQt.hasSetting( "PYHELLO", "creation_mode"):
        sgPyQt.addSetting( "PYHELLO", "creation_mode", 0 )
\endcode

- createPreferences() that initializes module preferences for the
 application's Preferences dialog box

\code
def createPreferences():
    if verbose() : print "PYHELLOGUI.createPreferences() : study : %d" % _getStudyId()
    gid = sgPyQt.addPreference( "General" )
    gid = sgPyQt.addPreference( "Object creation", gid )
    pid = sgPyQt.addPreference( "Default name",  gid, SalomePyQt.PT_String,   "PYHELLO", "def_obj_name" )
    pid = sgPyQt.addPreference( "Default creation mode", gid, SalomePyQt.PT_Selector, "PYHELLO", "creation_mode" )
    strings = QStringList()
    strings.append( "Default name" )
    strings.append( "Generate name" )
    strings.append( "Ask name" )
    indexes = []
    indexes.append( QVariant(0) )
    indexes.append( QVariant(1) )
    indexes.append( QVariant(2) )
    sgPyQt.setPreferenceProperty( pid, "strings", QVariant( strings ) )
    sgPyQt.setPreferenceProperty( pid, "indexes", QVariant( indexes ) )
    pass
\endcode

- windows() that defines dockable windows layout

\code
def windows():
    if verbose() : print "PYHELLOGUI.windows() : study : %d" % _getStudyId()
    wm = {}
    wm[SalomePyQt.WT_ObjectBrowser] = Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea
    wm[SalomePyQt.WT_PyConsole]     = Qt.BottomDockWidgetArea
    return wm
\endcode

Please refer to PYHELLOGUI.py script for more details about
implementation of other callback functions.

An implemention of the ShowHello() function is quite simple. It shows
the small dialog box allowing user to enter the name, and then uses
reference to the module CORBA engine to invoke its makeBanner()
service.

Note, that GUI elements of the Python module are implemented with help
of PyQt toolkit which provides a Python wrappings of the Qt library.

\ref idl_dir "<< Previous"<br>\ref bin_dir ">> Next"

\page bin_dir The bin directory

The file VERSION.in is used to document the module, it must define its
version and (optionally) its compatibilities or incompatibilities with
other modules. Therefore, it is strongly recommended but is not
essential for correct operation of the module.

The runPYHELLO.in file is the equivalent of the runSalome script
distributed by the KERNEL module but configured to start SALOME
session with PYHELLO module only.

The runPYHELLO.py file reuses part of functionality provided by the
KERNEL's runSalome.py script. It is used to run SALOME session and
start PYHELLO module in this session. 

\ref src_dir "<< Previous"<br>\ref doc_dir ">> Next"

\page doc_dir The doc directory

This directory provides documentation files of the module. The
documentation of the module can be implemented in the arbitrary
way. But if you want your documentation to appear in the SALOME GUI
desktop's Help menu, some specific actions should be done as follows.

The documentation should be generated in the HTML format. For example,
the documentation of the PYHELLO module is generated using Doxygen
tool. It allows to generate structured set of HTML pages from the set
of input plain text files. Input source files should include Doxygen
tags and optionally direct HTML tags. For more details please refer to
the Doxygen documentation.

The resulting documentation of a module should include at least one
file index.html. All the HTML and image files should be exported by
the build procedure to the following directory:
<module_installation_dir>/share/doc/salome/gui/<MODULE>
where <module_installation_dir> is a module installation folder and
MODULE is its name. For example, for PYHELLO module, at least one file
should exist:
<PYHELLO_module_installation_dir>/share/doc/salome/gui/PYHELLO/index.html. 

The SALOME GUI automatically searches for the index.html file in the
mentioned module directory. If the file is found, the corresponding
menu command is automatically added to the Help menu of the SALOME GUI
desktop.

\ref bin_dir "<< Previous"<br>\ref build_procedure ">> Next"

\page build_procedure Construction, installation

Before building PYHELLO module, please ensure that SALOME environment is
set properly. Assume that SALOME environment is set in env_products.sh
script. In order to build and install PYHELLO module, you have to
perform several steps:

<pre>
[bash% ] source env_products.sh
[bash% ] mkdir PYHELLO_BUILD
[bash% ] cd PYHELLO_BUILD
[bash% ] cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PYHELLO_module_installation_dir> ../PYHELLO1_SRC
[bash% ] make
[bash% ] make install
</pre>

The first command sets environment for building project.

Second command creates a build directory for the PYHELLO module. Then
next step is to cd to this build directory. From this directory you 
invoke cmake command, where <Mode> is build mode (Release or Debug),
<PYHELLO_module_installation_dir> is a destination folder to install PYHELLO module of SALOME.
By default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), PYHELLO module will be 
configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires root permissions 
to complete the installation. 

Next steps - build the package (\c make) and install it (\c make install). 

On each step, you have to ensure that the operation is finished correctly 
(no errors raised). After the last step is finished, the PYHELLO module is built
and installed to the \c \<PYHELLO_module_installation_dir\> directory.


\ref doc_dir "<< Previous"<br>\ref run_procedure ">> Next"

\page run_procedure Running SALOME

Go to the the <PYHELLO_module_installation_dir> directory and type:

<pre>
[bash% ] ./bin/salome/runPYHELLO
</pre>

This command runs SALOME session configured for KERNEL and the PYHELLO
module. At the end of running, the user will be prompted by the
Python interpreter command line configured for SALOME that provides
access to SALOME Python API (including CORBA interfaces).

The runPYHELLO file is a shell script that executes a Python commands
running SALOME session by passing arguments to it in a command line:
	
<pre>
${KERNEL_ROOT_DIR}/bin/salome/envSalome.py python -i $PYHELLO_ROOT_DIR/bin/salome/runPYHELLO.py --modules=PYHELLO --killall
</pre>

These arguments state that the runPYHELLO.py script located in the
PYHELLO module will be used, that the PYHELLO component will be
activated and all previously running SALOME sessions should be
shutdowned.

This command will not function unless the following environment
variables have previously been set:

<pre>
export KERNEL_ROOT_DIR=<KERNEL_module_installation_dir>
export PYHELLO_ROOT_DIR=<PYHELLO_module_installation_dir>
</pre>

\warning It is possible that the SALOME run will not reach the end.
In some circumstances, the time to start CORBA servers may be long and
could exceed the timeout. If the reasons is that the time to
load dynamic libraries is long, it is possible that a second run
immediately afterwards will be successful.
 
\ref build_procedure "<< Previous"<br>\ref load_module ">> Next"

\page load_module Loading PYHELLO component

The PYHELLO_ORB module has to be imported before making a request to
load the component into the container, to obtain access to methods of
the component.  This container is made accessible in the runPYHELLO.py
by means of the \b container variable:

<pre>
>> import PYHELLO_ORB
>> c=container.load_impl("PYHELLO","PYHELLO")
>> c.makeBanner("Christian")
</pre>

The last instruction returns a string "Hello Christian". Proceed as
follows to see the CORBA objects created by these actions:

<pre>
>> clt.showNS()
</pre>

\ref run_procedure "<< Previous"<br>\ref catalog_def ">> Next"

\page catalog_def PYHELLO module catalog definition

In the example from the previous chapter, the PYHELLO component was
loaded by making a direct request to the SALOME container. This is not
the standard method for loading of a component. The normal way uses
the SALOME LifeCycle service that invokes SALOME Module Catalog
services to identify the component and its properties and then calls
the requested container to load the component. 

Before this method can be used, the component must be declared in a
catalog in the XML format, for which the name must be
<Module>Catalog.xml. In our case, it will be PYHELLOCatalog.xml.
Usually this catalog is put to the resources sub-directory of the
directory tree. The simplest way to create this file is to use Catalog
Generator utility provided by the SALOME KERNEL module, that can
automatically generate XML description file from the IDL file.

\ref load_module "<< Previous"<br>\ref load_lcc ">> Next"

\page load_lcc Loading PYHELLO component via LifeCycle service

The method of loading the component is not very different from that
is described above. The services of the LifeCycle module are used in
this case instead of calling the container directly. The call sequence
is contained in the runPYHELLO.py \b test() function.

<pre>
    c=test(clt)
    c.makeBanner("Christian")
</pre>

The test function creates the LifeCycle object. It then asks for the
PYHELLO component to be loaded in the FactoryServer container:

\code
def test(clt):
    """
    Test function that creates an instance of PYHELLO component
    usage : hello=test(clt)
    """
    import LifeCycleCORBA
    lcc = LifeCycleCORBA.LifeCycleCORBA(clt.orb)
    import PYHELLO_ORB
    pyhello = lcc.FindOrLoadComponent("FactoryServePy", "PYHELLO")
    return pyhello
\endcode

\ref catalog_def "<< Previous"<br>\ref load_iapp ">> Next"

\page load_iapp Loading from the GUI (IAPP)

In order to activate PYHELLO module in the SALOME GUI desktop, the user
should press the PYHELLO module's button on the "Modules" toolbar or
select the name of the module in the combo box on this toolbar.

The image file to be used as an icon of a module should be exported by
the module build procedure. The icon file name is defined in the
corresponding SalomeApp.xml configuration file:
\code
  <section name="PYHELLO">
    <parameter name="name" value="Hello"/>
    <parameter name="icon" value="PYHELLO.png"/>
    <parameter name="library" value="SalomePyQtGUI"/>
